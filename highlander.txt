He is Duncan MacLeod, the Highlander. Born in 1592 in the Highlands of Scotland, and he is still alive. 
He is immortal. For four hundred years, he's been a warrior... a lover... a wanderer, constantly facing 
other Immortals in combat to the death. The winner takes his enemy's head, and with it, his power. I am 
a Watcher, part of a secret society of men and women who observe and record, but never interfere. We 
know the truth about Immortals. In the end, there can be only one. May it be Duncan MacLeod, the 
Highlander.
